# Text-to-Speech Project

This is a simple Text-to-Speech (TTS) application built using JavaScript's `SpeechSynthesis` API. It allows users to input text, select a voice, and have the text read aloud using the selected voice.

## Features
- Dynamically populates a list of available voices supported by the browser.
- Allows users to select a preferred voice from the list.
- Reads aloud text entered in a textarea.
- Provides an alert if no text is entered before clicking "Speak."

## Requirements
- A modern browser with support for the `SpeechSynthesis` API (e.g., Chrome, Firefox, Edge).

3. Open the `index.html` file in your browser.

## How It Works
1. **Voice Population**:
   - The `populateVoices` function retrieves all available voices and dynamically populates a `<select>` dropdown with their names and languages.
   - The default voice is marked in the list for user convenience.

2. **Voice Selection**:
   - When a user selects a voice from the dropdown, it updates the `speech.voice` property to use the selected voice.

3. **Text-to-Speech**:
   - When the "Speak" button is clicked, the application retrieves the text from the textarea and speaks it using the selected voice.

## Known Issues
- Some browsers may not immediately populate the voice list. Refreshing the page or triggering the `onvoiceschanged` event may resolve this.
